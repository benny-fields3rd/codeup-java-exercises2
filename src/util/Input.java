package util;


// 1. Create an input validation class
//Create a package inside of src named util. Inside of util, create a class named Input that has a private field named
// scanner. When an instance of this object is created, the scanner field should be set to a new instance of the
// Scanner class. The class should have the following methods, all of which return command line input from the user:

//      - String getString()
//      - boolean yesNo()
//      - int getInt(int min, int max)
//      - int getInt()
//      - double getDouble(double min, double max)
//      - double getDouble()

//The yesNo method should return true if the user enters y, yes, or variants thereof, and false otherwise.

//The getInt(int min, int max) method should keep prompting the user for input until they give an integer within the
// min and max. The getDouble method should do the same thing, but with decimal numbers.

//Create another class named InputTest that has a static main method that uses all the methods from the Input class.

//Bonus
//Allow all of your methods for getting input to accept an optional String parameter named prompt. If passed, the
// method should show the given prompt to the user before parsing the input.
